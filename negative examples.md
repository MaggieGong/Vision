**negative examples**

- objects from other classes that we are not interested in (e.g. don't want anything other than fruits)
- create another class for everything other that what's wanted

**2 ways of using Watson**

1. pre-trained classifiers

   â€‹	prepare images => classify => results

2. custom classifiers:

   â€‹	prepare training data => train and create new classifiers => classify => results
